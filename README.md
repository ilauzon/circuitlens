# CircuitLens
## Project Description
CircuitLens is a mobile app for Android devices that is a learning tool for boolean logic and logic circuit design. 

The goal of this app is to simplify the learning process of fundemental digital logic design, and to be a blank canvas for creative users to put together complex systems.

## Features
- (WIP) Create circuits with a variety of logical gates.
- (WIP) Write boolean functions and see them get translated into logical circuits.
- (WIP) Generate truth tables and Karnaugh maps.
- (WIP) Take pictures of hand-drawn logical circuits to digitize them.
- (WIP) Modularize components to improve performance and generate enormous systems.
### Extras
- (WIP) Share logical circuits with others.
- (WIP)

## Technologies Used
- Java 17
- Android Studio
